== README

This is my personal invoicing system, built on Ruby on Rails 4.0.0 a few years ago.
It served me well for years (when I was a freelancer) but it's not maintained anymore.

It was originally hosted on Openshift in the free tier, that's why there are many references to Openshift environment variable, (like `<%=ENV['OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME']%>`).

I'm storing it here on GitHub for future reference (or in case a become a freelancer again).
